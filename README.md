There is a file named USPopulation.txt in this project folder.  The file contains the midyear population of the United
States, in thousands, during the years 1950 through 1990.  The first line in the file contains the population for 1950,
the second line contains the population for 1951, and so forth.

Write a program that reads the file's contents into a list.  The program should display the following data:

* The average annual change in population during the time period
* The year with the greatest increase in population during the time period.
* The year with the smallest increase in population during the time period.
